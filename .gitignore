# TODO: Considering taking .vscode dir out of the repo. I want to look back at why
# I chose to track it. I might have been doing it to manage fine tuning of settings
# so it was mostly for visibility of changes caused via the GUI. It is valuable
# to really fine tune your IDE and also to have a handle on the settings themselves.
# Sometimes the best way to really fine tune your IDE is to manually edit settings.
# Not doing that here yet but I am pretty sure now that is why I was tracking the
# .vscode dir. Anyhow, lately I am mostly in PyCharm and WebStorm, but the same
# logic applies so perhaps I will start tracking .idea settings more now. These comments
# should be moved to a document about this topic to keep in my repos where I am doing
# this.
#
# We DO track .vscode settings, but not the launch/run settings currently:
.vscode/launch.json

# Python virtual environment directory:
.venv

# Python cache
__pycache__

# Python compiled bytecode files from imported modules:
*.pyc

# Setuptools distribution folder:

# Python egg metadata, regenerated from source files by setuptools:
/*.egg-info

# MacOS Finder custom attributes file:
