TODO: If and when we can execute things outside of Blender, we can improve things a lot and
eliminate the need for any path hacks by using 'pip install -e .' The -e option of pip install
in this local install context will perform the module install using symlinks and then we can
develop the module in its repository location and the .venv will immediately reflect the changes.
setup.py will need to be in the correct format.

Since we are currently only executing from within Blender, we will still need to use the
following path hack.

####################################################################################################
Add the current directory of the current blend file to the list of directories Python will search
to find modules for importing. In the current format, this project is only executed from within
Blender using the built-in Python environment. Importing of Boablend from the current
project/repository directory is enabled in this manner so that the Boablend module does not need
to be installed within Blender's python envirnoment. This configuration may change in the future
as there are a few other execution/module-installation configurations under consideration.
ADDITIONALLY:
It may be obvious from some perspectives, but also it is possible to prove the folowing statement
by displaying sys.path in various test configurations, but it may be important to note and to
advise developers/users of boablend that the following path manilulation (path hack) must be
be done in the boa file .. or possibly and maybe even preferably in the boablend_start file or
perhaps even better in the boablend_hook code .. but must not be attempted in any of the module
files or sub-module files of the library itself. Those module files are imported and we need the
path manipulation to be done in the EXECUTING context .. the MAIN code so to speak, not
in imported files (when you wamt to import another baoblend module for example) as sys.path may
not be the same in that context. (Or it might be .. but this would still be messy and confusing
even if it works.)
And this loading and then reloading should probably be done immediately after as well.
TODO: Do a trial move of this code to either boablend_hook or boablend_start. Might be a better home.
Use the diagnostic sys.path display methods.
