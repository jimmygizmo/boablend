Install all of the code in boablend_hook.py into a Text Object within Blender.
It is recommended to name this Text Object 'boablend_hook'.

Click 'Run Script' on this Text Object or perform an equivalent action to run the current Boablend
project configuration. Other modes of execution may be available in the future. Dispatching of
different/specific Boa files occurs in boablend_start.py. This hook code should remain as generic
and simple as possible.

Hook code  will likely always be a very small amount of code. If any changes are ever needed to
the hook code or if it is updated along with this project, you will need to manually (cut/paste)
the updated hook code back into the blend file Text object.
