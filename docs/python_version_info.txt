Blender.org is close to releasing a major new version of Blender: 2.80.
This Boablend project is being developed on MacOS using the just-released
MacOS build of Blender 2.80 Beta, released May 15, 2019. The internally-bundled
Python environment in this version of Blender 2.80b (Mac) is version 3.7.0.

The local Python on the current MacOS development machine is installed and
maintained by Homebrew, which is the best package manager to use on Mac for
Python and numerous other packages.

Homebrew refers to python3 as just 'python' in terms of formulae names.
The python3 binary is installed at:
/usr/local/bin/python3

Currently this local Homebrew python3 is at version 3.7.3 which is close enough
to the Blender 2.80b (MacOS) bundled Python version of 3.7.0 so it is not
considered necessary to make the local Homebrew Python match this and 3.7.3
should be fine.

Note that in the initial stages of this project, it is only planned to use
Blender's bundled Python and the Homebrew python3 will only be used by the
VSCode IDE while coding. In the future however, steps may be taken to have
Blender use the external Homebrew python3 and this will likely come about when
there is a need to install additional python modules. When that time comes,
it is also planned to have Blender use a Python virtual environment.

The best method of accomplishing the externalization of python and the usage
of a virtual environment with Blender 2.80b remains to be worked out.
