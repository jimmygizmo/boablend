Boa files use importlibs reload.

Importlib's reload() is used to ensure that every time this project is executed, any Boablend code
changes will be picked up. This is necessary in the case that the Blender blend file containing
the Boablend hook has not been restarted because Blender's Python environment internally caches
imported modules and this cache persists while the blend file is open. You can reload any module
by its full/absolute/canonical name format OR by its 'as' alias. Either one works.

We use an alias with the import of boablend.constants:

import boablend.constants as CONST

So the question arose, to use importlib.reload(), do we reload boablend.constants or do we
reload CONST? Does it matter. Tests were done. Either way works equally well.
Either format can be used:
importlib.reload(boablend.constants)
importlib.reload(CONST)
