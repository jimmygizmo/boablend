Regarding:
'import bpy' showing and error in IDE, but works when boablend running via Blender blend file.

'import bpy'
This import is not needed under the current execution model and it will not currently
work because we do not yet have an external bpy build in the boablend environment.
The import of bpy of course DOES work when we are in the execution context of a running Blender
instance and an executing Text object script in an open blend file and in the case of boablen,
when execution begins within the boablend Blender hook code. However, extra steps are needed in
order to make 'import bpy' work for external execution as well as to make it recognized by the
IDE as a valid import when the IDE has the boablend .venv Python virtual environment activated.

*** To install bpy requires compilation and this is currently failing. When the bpy build and
python module install is working, then we can make 'import bpy' work for external execution and
for the VSCode/IDE code inspection features.
The build failure cmake error is detailed here:
/docs/bpy_build_cmake_error.txt
See also some comments in init.sh for more information on the bpy build
failure. This does not prevent the use of boablend within Blender, but it would be nice to fix
this abd be able to initiate execution from Python/boablend code, independent of the Blender GUI.
Of course this is possible with many options for the GUI or even windoless rendering etc., and
capabilities in these areas will evolve as boablend does.
