# Project-specific Python dependencies

# This requirements.txt file should be located in the root directory of this
# project/repository.

# There are two reasons why this requirements.txt file is currently
# empty:

# 1. Currently there are no project-specific Python dependencies in use.
# 2. This is a Blender project and at this initial stage, only Blender's
# built-in Python environment will be used. Using this requirements.txt to
# install project dependencies with pip will only become necessary file once
# this project executes externally from the BLender application.
