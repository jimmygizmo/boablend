# This __init__.py file must be in place for module structure but currently has no functional role
# in boablend. 'import boabled' would import the content of this file if there was any.
# Currently 'import boablend' does not do anything and causes no error. This file is
# where that code would go, since this is a directory-level namespace.
#
# All modules in boablend must be imported individually to use. e.g.
# 'import boablend.util'
# 'import boablend.constants'
# 'import boablend.primitive.cube'
