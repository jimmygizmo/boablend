#import bpy  # This import is not needed under the current execution model and it will not currently
# work because we do not yet have an external bpy build in the boablend environment.
#
# The import of bpy of course DOES work within Blender and when execution begins within the boablend
# Blender hook code. However, extra steps are needed in order to make it work for external execution
# as well as to make it recognized by the IDE as a valid import. To install bpy requires compilation
# and this is currently failing. When the bpy build and python module install is working, then we
# can make 'import bpy' work for external execution and for the VSCode/IDE code inspection features.
# See the build error log in this repo and comments in init.sh for more information on the bpy build
# failure. This does not prevent the use of boablend within Blender, but it would be nice to fix for
# a more complete and full-featured project.
