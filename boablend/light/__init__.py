# This __init__.py file must be in place for module structure but currently has no functional role
# in boablend. 'import boabled.light' would import the content of this file if there was any.
# Currently 'import boablend.light' does not do anything and causes no error. This file is
# where that code would go, since this is a directory-level namespace.
#
# To use a light, import it individually. e.g. 'import boablend.light.sun'
#
