# This __init__.py file must be in place for module structure but currently has no functional role
# in boablend. 'import boabled.primitives' would import the content of this file if there was any.
# Currently 'import boablend.primitives' does not do anything and causes no error. This file is
# where that code would go, since this is a directory-level namespace.
#
# To use primitives, import them individually. e.g. 'import boablend.primitives.cube'
#
