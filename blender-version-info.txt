Boablend is currently designed to work with Blender 2.8.
As of Spring 2022, this Blender is now a few years old. (But still Amazing!)
YOu should never be afraid of using older software version if all the features
you need and more are still working fine in it.
The internal Blender Python API does change and is mysterious and tricky to
work with, so Boablend will not always be guaranteed to work on the latest
version and will Boablend versions will be tied directly with specific
Blender versions for this reason.

In the near future, Boablend will be brought up to date to work with the
current Blender release which is version 3.1.2, or likely higher by the
time this work is done.

BUT FOR NOW, you will need to use Boablend only with Blender 2.8 and this is no
problem because Boablend does not try to push the limits of Blender and is
most valuable for more straightforward geometric enjoyment and experimentation.

Blender.org is great for support of old versions.
